Welcome to my first Python game built with **Streamlit**!

Itâ€™s a digital version of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game where you play against the computer â€” complete with emojis, a live scoreboard, and some fun effects.  

ðŸ‘‰ Play the game [here](https://classical-game.streamlit.app/)!
